# NFL Game Schedule Backend - Development Checklist

## Phase 1: Core Foundation

### Project Setup
- [x] Create Python 3 project structure with standard directories (`src/`, `tests/`, etc.)
- [x] Setup minimal `requirements.txt` with Starlette and uvicorn
- [x] Create basic Starlette application with health check endpoint (`GET /health`)
- [x] Add environment configuration loading using `os.environ`
- [x] Setup basic logging configuration using standard `logging` module

### ESPN API Integration
- [x] Create ESPN API client using `urllib.request` for HTTP calls
- [x] Implement function to fetch scoreboard data from ESPN endpoint
- [x] Add basic error handling for network failures and invalid responses
- [x] Create unit tests for ESPN API client with mock responses
- [x] Add request timeout configuration (30 seconds default)

### Data Models
- [x] Define Python dataclass or dict structure for Game objects
- [x] Create function to parse ESPN JSON response into Game objects
- [x] Implement ESPN season type to our type mapping (1→pre-season, 2→regular-season, etc.)
- [x] Add timezone conversion from ESPN timestamps to UTC using `datetime` and `zoneinfo`
- [x] Create unit tests for data parsing with sample ESPN responses

## Phase 2: API Endpoints

### Today's Games Endpoint
- [x] Implement `GET /games/today` endpoint in Starlette
- [x] Add logic to filter games by current date (using system timezone)
- [x] Return JSON response matching specified format
- [x] Add error handling for empty results
- [x] Create integration test for today's games endpoint

### Weekly Games Endpoint
- [ ] Implement `GET /games/week` endpoint for current NFL week
- [ ] Add NFL week calculation logic (Week 1 starts first Thursday in September)
- [ ] Filter games by calculated week range
- [ ] Return JSON response with weekly games
- [ ] Create integration test for weekly games endpoint

### Flexible Date Endpoint
- [ ] Implement `GET /games/{date}` endpoint with date parameter validation
- [ ] Parse YYYY-MM-DD date format using `datetime.strptime`
- [ ] Filter ESPN data by specified date
- [ ] Add 400 error response for invalid date formats
- [ ] Create tests for various date formats and edge cases

## Phase 3: Caching & Optimization

### In-Memory Caching
- [ ] Implement simple in-memory cache using Python `dict`
- [ ] Add cache expiration logic (24-hour TTL)
- [ ] Cache ESPN API responses to avoid repeated calls
- [ ] Add cache hit/miss logging
- [ ] Create tests for cache behavior and expiration

### Error Handling & Resilience
- [ ] Add comprehensive exception handling for all endpoints
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation when ESPN API is unavailable
- [ ] Add structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] Create fallback response for cached data when ESPN API fails
- [ ] Add logging for all error scenarios

### Data Validation
- [ ] Validate required fields are present in ESPN response
- [ ] Handle missing venue information gracefully
- [ ] Add validation for team names/identifiers
- [ ] Log data quality issues without breaking responses
- [ ] Create tests for malformed ESPN data scenarios

## Phase 4: Production Readiness

### Configuration & Environment
- [ ] Add environment-specific configuration (dev/prod ESPN endpoints)
- [ ] Implement configurable cache TTL via environment variables
- [ ] Add configurable request timeout settings
- [ ] Create example `.env` file with all configuration options
- [ ] Document all environment variables in README

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add structured logging with JSON format option
- [ ] Implement request/response logging middleware
- [ ] Add timing metrics for ESPN API calls
- [ ] Create performance logging for cache operations
- [ ] Add startup/shutdown lifecycle logging

### Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Create comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Document all API endpoints with example responses
- [ ] Add Docker configuration for containerized deployment
- [ ] Create simple deployment script or instructions
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Phase 5: Testing & Quality

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Achieve >90% test coverage for core business logic
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Add performance tests for typical e-ink display usage patterns
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests with real ESPN API calls (optional)
- [ ] Add tests for timezone edge cases and daylight saving time

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add type hints to all functions and classes
- [ ] Implement basic code formatting standards
- [ ] Add docstrings to all public functions
- [ ] Create simple code organization and module structure
- [ ] Add input validation for all public APIs

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements Met
- [ ] All endpoints return data in specified JSON format
- [ ] Timezone conversion to UTC works correctly
- [ ] ESPN season type mapping is accurate
- [ ] Cache reduces ESPN API calls to maximum once per day
- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully

### Non-Functional Requirements Met  
- [ ] Application starts and responds within 10 seconds
- [ ] API responses complete within 2 seconds under normal conditions
- [ ] Application runs stably for 24+ hours without intervention
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable over multiple cache cycles
- [ ] Logs provide sufficient information for debugging issues
